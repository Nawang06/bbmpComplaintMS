# bbmpComplaintMS
A mini project created for an FS Course for the 6th Semester of my B.E Course 

It showcases all the basic concepts of File Structures such as Reading, Writing and Modifying.

It also utilizes the Sequential Searching Technique to find the various Complaint IDs which will be unique and automatically generated by the program.

The Language Used here is Python!!

It's a simple project and can be easily run in the OS with the Python Environments set.

The Complaints File stores the complaints from the users

The Users File, as the name suggests, stores the name of the users associated with the file
